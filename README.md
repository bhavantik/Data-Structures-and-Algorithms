4. leetcode: Tagged problems for Google, Amazon, Meta, MST, etc. (Sort by most freq. asked in last 6 months)
5. Add 10-15 System Design question from neetcode

# 3. Interviewing.io or Pramp (Free mock interviews)
- Platform to get real mock interviews with engineers from Google, Uber, etc.
- You'll get live feedback.
‚úÖ Start once you're solving Leetcode confidently

# 4. AlgoExpert or Taro
- AlgoExpert gives structured prep for DSA + system design.
- Taro gives career mentorship and FAANG preparation for experienced candidates.

# 5. System Design Prep (for MAANG)
- Only if you‚Äôre targeting ML Engineer / Senior DS roles:
    - Grokking System Design
    - Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann (for depth)

#### High ROI videos:
- Gaurav Sen (YouTube)
- System Design Primer GitHub

# 6. HFT/Quant Specific
- If targeting Jane Street, Tower, etc.:

#### ‚û§ Math + Puzzles:
- Green Book (Heard on the Street by CrackQuant)
- [Xinfeng Zhou 100 Questions PDF (Google it)] ‚Äì goldmine for quant math
- Project Euler

#### ‚û§ Competitive Programming:
- Focus only if targeting HFT
- Codeforces Div2 B/C, Atcoder Beginner contests

# 7. üéØ What You Specifically Need (Based on Your Profile)
### For MAANG DS/ML Role:
- 100-150 smart DSA problems (Neetcode/Blind75)
- Strong ML fundamentals: sklearn, deep learning basics
- System design: ML pipelines, real-time architecture
- Projects with impact, A/B testing, modeling etc.

### For Quant/HFT Role:
- Strong math/stats/probability + puzzles
- 80+ hard Leetcode problems (arrays, graphs, DP)
- Python/C++ proficiency
- Resume with competition experience or side projects (optional but helps)

# 8. üî• Bonus Tips to Achieve High CTC Faster
- Referral > Apply blindly ‚Üí Ask on LinkedIn or join Discord groups (e.g., Taro)
- Focus on big firms hiring in India at high CTC:
- Google Research India, Amazon Applied Science, Adobe, Microsoft Research, Indeed, Rubrik, Arcesium, Graviton, Squarepoint, Millennium
- Mention IIT + real projects on resume clearly
- Use Resume Worded, Rezi.ai, or Teal to optimize resume
- Negotiate: Counter offers, understand pay structure (bonus, stock)

# 9. ‚úÖ TL;DR Checklist
- Neetcode 150 / Blind 75 ‚Äì 2 rounds
- Crack 5-10 mock interviews (Interviewing.io or peers)
- Quant puzzles + Math DS for HFT/Quant
- Resume optimized with impact & keywords
- Practice system design for ML pipelines
- Join groups (Slack, Taro, Discord, LinkedIn) for referrals

# Note: 

-  Avoid jumping to random problems or overdoing hard ones. Focus on problem types, not volume.

## Choose Target Path
| Track               | Target Roles                    | Key Areas                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. MAANG DS/ML Engg | ML Engineer, Applied Scientist  | DSA, ML, System Design                           |
| 2. Quant Fund       | Quant Researcher, Quant Dev     | Probability, Stats, Leetcode hard, Python/C++    |
| 3. HFT/Trading      | Quant Trader, Software Engineer | C++, CP (Codeforces/Atcoder), Math, Low-level DS |


# üîç What About CodeChef, HackerRank, Codeforces?

| Platform               | Good For                               | When to Use                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **LeetCode**           | Interviews (DSA), MAANG/DS roles       | ‚úÖ Must do                                |
| **NeetCode**           | Curated learning roadmap               | ‚úÖ Must refer                             |
| **CodeChef**           | Competitive programming                | ‚ùå Not needed unless you're targeting HFT |
| **HackerRank**         | Warm-up platform, DS contests          | Optional (not essential)                 |
| **Codeforces/AtCoder** | Hardcore CP, useful for HFT/Quant Devs | ‚úÖ Only if you're going to HFT            |

- So:
    - If you're targeting MAANG roles ‚Üí Stick with LeetCode + NeetCode
    - If you're targeting Quant/Algo Trading firms (e.g., Jane Street, Tower) ‚Üí Add Codeforces Div2 B/C + Math puzzles
